            <h2>The Seed of Our Idea</h2>
            <p>The Local Food Market was founded on a simple belief: that vibrant, healthy communities are built around **fresh, accessible food** and strong relationships between farmers and neighbors. Every purchase supports a local family and reduces our collective carbon footprint.</p>
            <p>Our goal is to create a sustainable cycle that benefits everyone, from the soil to your table.</p>
